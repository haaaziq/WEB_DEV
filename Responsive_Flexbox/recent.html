                        <h3>Finding simplicity in life</h3>
                        <p>
                            Life can get complicated really quickly, but it doesn't have to be! There are many ways 
                            to simplify your life, a few of which we've explored in the past. This week we're taking 
                            a bit of a approach though, in how you can find simplicity in the life you already living.

                        <h3>Keeping cooking simple</h3>
                        <p>
                            Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be healthy, you have 
                            to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking nice and 
                            simple.

                        <h3>Simplicity and work</h3>
                        <p>
                            Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their relationship 
                            with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will 
                            help balance everything out.

                        <p>
                            A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't decorate, or 
                            they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple 
                            will help draw the eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before.
