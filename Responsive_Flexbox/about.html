                    <p>
                        <strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong>, I had so many things that I thought that I 
                        loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
                        <br><br>
                        Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and 
                        I couldn't hold a relationship.
                        <br>
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="about_title about_subtitle">How I turned things around</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong>,I 
                        literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a 
                        smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                        <br><br>
                        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, 
                        I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
                        <br>
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="about_title about_subtitle">Now I live the simple life</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, 
                        enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
                        <br><br>
                        With how much it turned my life around,<strong> I felt like I had no choice but to 
                        start sharing how I did it,</strong> and how others can benefit from living a simple
                         life as well, which is why I started this site!
